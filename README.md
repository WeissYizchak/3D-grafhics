# 3D-grafhics
This is my project in **Introduction to Software Engineering** course.  
I did the project with [@Ruli Yakovson](https://github.com/RulyYakovson).

## Description  
The software has the ability to model  

basic geometrical shapes such:
* points
* vectors  

geometric shapes in 3D:
* square
* circle
* triangle
* ball
* cylinder

The software describes a scene composed of many geometric shapes,  
then the software simulates taking a picture of the scene and creates a picture of it in a jpg file.


I added to the project an implementation of the 3D-DDA algorithm.
